# Hi! My name is Nischal and this is an attempt at developing my portfolio website

For all the experience I have as a developer I have very little to show for it, and no place to show even that! So here's to fixing one of those problems by having a place to display my (few) works. This is v1 for me and I'd appreciate any criticism or feedback you have for me ðŸ˜Š.

# Contributions

If you have any suggestions for thing I could improve on I would love the feedback. I'm still new to Open Source and contribution so bear with me while I set up a format and flow for help.
